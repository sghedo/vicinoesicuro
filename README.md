# Vicinoesicuro, the non-profit map against Coronavirus

## About the project

[**Vicinoesicuro**](https://vicinoesicuro.it/) is a **nonâ€“profit** project against the Covid-19 outbreak and was launched in Italy a few hours after the announcement of the lockdown by Prime Minister Conte on March 9, 2020.

The project, completely free of charge, **offers a navigable map of all the activities that make home deliveries** : shops, bars, restaurants, newsstands, laundries and more.

**Users** can choose the type of service they need, consult the information on delivery methods and possible costs, and contact the shop owner directly. By registering in [Vicinoesicuro](https://vicinoesicuro.it/), **retailers** can increase their visibility without any advertising investment.

Starting nov 13th **Vicinoesicuro** is also available on the [App Store](https://bit.ly/vicinoesicuro-appstore) and [Google Play Store](https://bit.ly/vicinoesicuro-playstore) (italian markets only).

### Vicinoesicuro is a project made by volunteers

Managed by **volunteers** and initially available only in the province of Reggio Emilia, the project has grown throughout Italy and was extended to other European countries (among the first France) thanks to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/?hl=it) grants (which, believing in the initiative, has provided us with free credits for the use of Maps) and [Web Geo Services](https://www.webgeoservices.com/it/), the company behind [Woosmap](https://www.woosmap.com/en/), which is the technology that provides the map UI.

**Vicinoesicuro** was developed together with [Alfredo Colella](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alfredocolella/), [Cristiano Ferrari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristianoferrari/), [Francesco del Bosco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francescodelbosco) and [Federico Capucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/capuccifederico/).

## Why GitHub

**Vicinoesicuro** was published on GitHub with the aim of favoring the replication of the project in other countries, as well as allowing its evolution thanks to the contribution of those who will decide to improve a project that is very simple in itself as you will see from the code.
