# Where to start with your Vicinoesicuro

As you will notice all files with customizable strings, API keys or other personal ID are well commented.

In particular:
* In all **HTML root files** you will find strings as INSERT-YOUR-WEBSITE-DESCRIPTION-HERE or INSERT-YOUR-URL-HERE. Search for **INSERT** to search and replace all the necessary strings.
* In **js/scripts.js** you will find a dozen of settings at its top so that you won't need to deep dive into it. More info on how to customize the filters will be provided later. 
* In **css/style.css** there is only one setting for the base color.
